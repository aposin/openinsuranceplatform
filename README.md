# openinsuranceplatform (software description)

The software provides a comprehensive core insurance platform delivering the complete scope of business capabilities for the insurance industry across all lines of business and business models (B2C, B2B, B2B2C). The open source project is the starting point for all further insurance platform implementations.

It is an all-class system meaning that all insurance classes (like motor, life, health, property) can be regulated with the same software. This makes the system functionally comprehensive and all-encompassing.

By enabling fully automated core insurance processes, it helps organizations to get fit for digital competition.

A system-wide data model creates a solid basement for further extensions. Based on this model it provides comprehensive functionality for party management, contract managementa and claims management as well as cross-cutting functionality for organizational setup, collection & disbursement, commission, product definition, workflow, reinsurance and output Management.

The software is organization-neutral, so every form of organization can be displayed. The workflow engine enables the setup of different organizational structures (specialization, segmentation) and workflow automation between and within organizational structures. Flexible configuration of business rules facilitate fast implementation and change of business processes as well as organizational setup and integration of contact channels (phone, e-mail, sms, scanned documents, fax, portals, social media).

The software propagates a layered platform architecture thus facilitating adaptation to customer-specific organizations, processes, markets and is built to foster business process automation minimizing manual intervention and optimizing user experience. A 360Â° view on customers and business partners is provided by operating on a single database. Multi-access is provided by default. Adding specific functionality to the system is made easy via extension mechanisms provided on all layers of the system architecture (database, persistence layer, business logic, GUI).

Business logic is also accessible via RESTful services enabling true 2-speed-architecture projects (e.g. apps, portals). Web services and multiple interfaces to surrounding systems mandatory for core insurance platforms, are available as well. The software easily connects to value-adding services (e.g. fraud detection, geographical information) or decision taking across all core insurance process steps. A web client is provided by default and enables internet portals or mobile applications providing the right user interface and user experience for various user groups (e.g. sales people, customers, workshops, back-office).

Power users have access to the full set of functionality within the software at high speed, reaching best practice productivity benchmarks and making training as lean as possible. Non-IT people can update product definitions and workflow rules within a day, demonstrating competitive time-to-market performance.

The software strives for using existing open source components where appropriate rather than commercial software and enables a lean infrastructure footprint.
